We did not further check the model misspecifications. If we were to publish our results as a team, we would probably carefully check the data and models and try to address these. We encountered various error messages while running our models (we did not follow them up).

Importantly, as noted in previous communications, there seem to be problems with the data. We did not carefully check the invariance tests again, but it seems that the relative invariance parameters changed, suggesting problems with the blinding procedure and/or data.
