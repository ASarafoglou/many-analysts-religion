We fit models of varying complexity and employed approximate leave-one-out cross-validation (Vehtari et al., 2017) to compare the models’ out-of-sample predictive performance. Q2 calls for the assessment of the possible existence of an interaction effect between Religiosity and perceived importance of religiosity (Cultural Norms), so that the association between wellbeing and religiosity is moderated by perceived importance of religiosity in one’s country. However, because we suspected that the two focal predictors – religiosity and cultural norms – possibly were
partially overlapping measures of the same underlying construct, we pre-registered two analytic scenarios. If the two focal predictors were found to be sufficiently distinct, Scenario 1 would model them as separate predictors and their interaction. If the two focal predictors were found to be nearly indistinguishable, Scenario 2 would collapse the items and instead address Q2 more indirectly, by modeling the association between well-being and the deviance from country-mean religiosity, where country-mean religiosity serves as a proxy for the importance of religion for an “average person” (cf., MARP document “Data Documentation”) in each country.

The model was fitted using the Mplus software and based on a recent publication by Asparouhov & Muthén (2020): ""Bayesian estimation of single and multilevel models with latent variable interactions"".","I assumed religiosity, perceived cultural norms or religion, and wellbeing to be latent variables. Religiosity and perceived cultural norms were both modeled using a single factor model. General wellbeing was modeled as a higher-order model, with four lower-order latent variables for each of the four wellbeing facets. A higher-order general wellbeing factor was assumed to explain the associations between those four latent wellbeing variables. The higher-order wellbeing factor was the dependent measure in the model. 
Each latent variable had a measurement model explaining its relation to the item scores. Item scores were modeled at their ordered categorical (ordinal) measurement level. This involved estimating threshold parameters instead of intercepts in the measurement model of each factor. 
As the data were gathered in different countries, I used a multilevel structure to take into account a possible dependency in the scores of participants within a country. The intercept in the structural regression on the higher-order wellbeing factor was considered random, allowing this intercept to vary across different countries. Included covariates of the higher-order wellbeing at the individual level were the manifest variables age, ses, education and gender (dummy coded into two variables because of the 3 answer categories). At the country level, GDP_scaled was used as a predictor of the higher-order wellbeing factor.
I used Bayesian estimation because the dimensions of numerical integration required to fit this model using maximum likelihood was computationally extremely intensive. The default Mplus priors were used for all parameters. The default prior for intercepts, regression slopes, threshold and loading parameters is N(0,). The default for variance parameters, i.e., variance covariance blocks of size 1 is IG(-1, 0). The default for variance covariance blocks of size bigger than 1 is IW(0, -p-1), where p is the size of the matrix (for more info on these prior distributions see Asparouhov, T., & Muthén, B. (2010). Bayesian analysis of latent variable models using Mplus). A maximum of 250000 iterations was used for each MCMC chain to allow proper convergence. 
I fitted the same model to test hypotheses 1 and 2 with one difference: in the model testing the first hypothesis (main effect religiosity on wellbeing) the latent interaction effect between religiosity and cultural norms was constrained to zero, whereas it was freely estimated in the model testing the second hypothesis. I used standardized regression coefficients (including 95% Bayesian credible interval) to express the effect size.

RQ1: A one-way, between participants ANOVA is a specific type of linear model, which can be used to determine if there is a difference on a continuous outcome measure (in this case, wellbeing) in participants who appear in only one of a single categorical independent variable (in this case, self-labelled religious identity).  

RQ1 & RQ2: We conducted moderated mediation models (which we called structural equational modelling (SEM) in the pre-registration) to provide further information on the nature of any potential relationships found, in the form of including covariates, moderators or mediator effects, for RQ1 and RQ2, going somewhat beyond the question as to whether there are differences, to asking why there might be differences, if so (e.g., the pathways). 

SEM is a multivariate statistical analysis technique which combines multiple regression analyses with factor analysis. In the pre-registration we called our moderated mediation analyses SEMs, but we are actually no longer sure that is adequate, as we do not employ any kind of factor analysis.  

This is important because we used SEM fit criteria based on Kline (2011): The model would be acceptable if CFI > 0.90, RMSEA ≤ 0.08, and SRMR ≤ 0.08 . None of our proposed models met these criteria. However, if our moderated mediation models should not be considered SEMs, then it may be that our proposed SEM criteria were too stringent, while some relevant pathways (indirect or total) of the moderated mediation models were significant (which would normally be considered a significant result for mediation models). 

Either way, we have also provided an alternative, not-preregistered analysis in question 9 to answer RQ2 (we did discuss this analysis in December 2020, but have not pre-registered it with you, and are therefore accepting that this is an exploratory analysis only).

We then created a group-level mean of this cultural norms variable, such that each country had a single cultural norms score.  The wording of cnorm_1 and cnorm_2 was similar to that of rel_8 and rel_9, where rel_8 and rel_9 asked these questions in the context of one’s personal importance of religiosity compared to cnorm_1 and cnorm_2 asked these questions in the context of the importance of religiosity within their country’s culture.

This was a planned modification that was explained in my original syntax. (2) I modified the syntax to provide a confidence interval for the standardized regression coefficients (beta). To obtain a confidence interval for the standardized regression coefficients, I also standardized all of the variables that were used in the regression models. (3) I added Overall Well-Being as a dependent variable. Originally, I planned to analyze the effects of personal religiosity on Physical Well-Being, Psychological Well-Being, and Social Well-Being separately. I did not plan to analyze Overall Well-Being, as I hypothesized that religiosity may not have the same impact on different types of well-being. However, as each analysis team was only allowed to provide one numerical estimate of the impact of personal religiosity on well-being (not 3 estimates taken from 3 different regressions), I added the necessary analyses to examine the effects of personal religiosity on Overall Well-Being. ","A few comments:

1. Somehow, I did not realize at the beginning of the project that analysts would need to provide one, and only one, estimate for each research question. I also didn’t realize that analysts would need to provide a confidence interval for the standardized regression coefficient. I may have overlooked a communication about this, but it would have been helpful to know this information when planning the analyses. In step 2, I needed to make modifications to my syntax, as I hadn’t realized these parameters/expectations when developing my syntax in step 1.

2. The rel_1, rel_2, rel_3, and rel_4 variables were coded in the data set on a 0-1 scale. As such, these variables initially appeared to be on an interval/ratio scale. However, from reviewing the questionnaire, these variables were actually on a nominal or ordinal scale. As such, it was more difficult to use these variables in the analyses. I also wonder whether any analysts didn’t realize that these variables were on a nominal/ordinal scale, since they initially looked like interval/ratio variables in the data set. 

3. The rel_2 variable (frequency of prayer) had a challenging response option: “Only when attending religious services”. This response option was coded to have a frequency falling between “Several times each week” and “Only on special holy days”. However, for participants who endorsed this response option, it would be necessary to actually review their response to rel_1. Someone who only prays when they attend religious services would be endorsing very different frequencies of prayer if they attend religious services several times a week versus once a year, for instance. If analysts used the rel_2 variable without considering participants’ responses to rel_1, incorrect assumptions may have been made about those that responded “only when attending religious services”.

Hence, a principal component analysis specifying that one component should be extracted was conducted, and componential scores were obtained through the regression method. Participants (ntotal =  10,535) were then split based on the interquartile range of componential scores, resulting in four distinct groups. 
To test Hypothesis 1, a one-way ANOVA was conducted considering the groups obtained by the interquartile range of componential scores as the independent variable and the average of all 18 well-being items (indexed by the variable “wb_overall_mean”) as the dependent variable. No covariates were inserted in the model. Results suggested that the more one is religious, the higher the overall well-being (F (1, 10533) = 131.10, p < .001, η² = .01, 95% Confidence Interval = [.01, .02]), such that the group with lowest componential score (Group 1 - M = 3.62, SD = .65) had a similar average of well-being in comparison to the group with the second-lowest componential score (Group 2 - M = 3.60, SD = .62), but both were lower than the third (Group 3 - M = 3.66, SD = .59) and fourth groups (Group 4 - M = 3.80, SD = .55). Although not pre-registered, we conducted post-hoc analyses using the Tukey method, and it indicated statistically significant differences between scores of group 4 versus group 1 (p < .001), group 2 (p < .001) and group 3 (p < .001). Furthermore, the scores of group 3 were also significantly higher than the scores of group 2 (p = .005). Hypothesis 1 was thus supported.

For research question 2: Although we had pre-registered that “as there are no missing data on well-being, religiosity and perceived cultural norms, missing data will not be an issue”, we observed that one of the variables assessing well-being (“wb_soc_3”) had 995 missing cases. These cases were thus deleted through the listwise method. 
Participants were split based on the perceived cultural norms of religion. Therefore, we calculated the mean of the two variables assessing it (“cnorm_1” [importance of religious lifestyle for average person in country], “cnorm_2” [importance of belief in God/Gods for average person in country]) and two groups were created based on the median score (.38), separating those with lower vs higher perceived cultural norms levels. Afterward, two independent partial correlation networks were assessed. 
Network analyses provide a visualization of the association between variables through nodes and edges. For partial correlation networks, each node represents a variable and each edge represents their partial association, such that positive associations are represented by green edges and negative associations are represented by red edges (Epskamp et al., 2012). In the present study, the networks were obtained through the LASSO (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regularization technique, using the tuning parameter λ = 0.5 and the EBIC (Extended Bayesian Information Criterion) selection method (Friedman et al., 2008). 
To test Hypothesis 2, two distinct networks were assessed. Both assessed the partial correlations between the variables indexing religiosity (“rel_1”, “rel_2”, “rel_3”, “rel_4”, “rel_5”, “rel_6”, “rel_7”, “rel_8”, “rel_9”) and the variables indexing well-being (“wb_gen_1”, “wb_gen_2”, “wb_phys_1”, “wb_phys_2”, “wb_phys_3”, “wb_phys_4”, “wb_phys_5”, “wb_phys_6”, “wb_phys_7”, “wb_psych_1”, “wb_psych_2”, “wb_psych_3”, “wb_psych_4”, “wb_psych_5”, “wb_psych_6”, “wb_soc_1”, “wb_soc_2”, “wb_soc_3”). However, the first network only considered the data of the group with lower perceived cultural norms of religion (mean score ≤ .38, ranging from 0 to .38, n = 5,055) and the second network only considered the data of the group with higher perceived cultural norms of religion (mean score > .38, ranging from .50 to 1, n = 4,485). The global connectivity of these networks (i.e. the weighted absolute sum of all edges in the network) was compared to verify if the connectivity between religiosity and well-being differed across groups with lower vs higher levels of perceived cultural norms of religion (van Borkulo et al., 2016).
Results suggested that the perceived cultural norms of religion do not significantly affect the relationship between religiosity and well-being. For instance, the global connectivity of the variables in the group with lower levels of perceived cultural norms (12.95) was not significantly different (S = .28, p =.32) than its higher counterpart (13.22), rejecting our Hypothesis 2. The partial correlation networks are depicted in Figures 1 and 2, available at the document uploaded in the OSF folder.","     The level of religiosity was operationalized through the componential score of the variables assessing religiosity (i.e. “rel_1” [frequency of service attendance], “rel_2” [frequency of prayer], “rel_3” [self-identification as religious, not religious or atheist], “rel_4” [belong to denomination], “rel_5” [belief in God/Gods], “rel_6”[belief in afterlife], “rel_7” [spirituality], “rel_8” [importance of religious lifestyle], “rel_9” [importance of belief in God/Gods]).","We used the variable ""wb_overall_mean"".","None","Eta squared",".01 [.01, .02]","p < .001","-.-","Yes, there is good evidence for a positive relation","Yes",5,"Participants were split based on the perceived cultural norms of religion.

For Q2, I originally planned to use separate multi-level multiple regression models to regress the different measures of individual (i.e., level 1) wellbeing (physical, psychological, social, general, and overall) on to the level 1 predictor (religiosity), the level 1 covariates (age, gender, ses, education, and religious denomination), the country level (level 2) predictor (perceived cultural norms of religion), and the level 2 covariates (religiosity and GDP). However, as I started to work with the data, I realized my initial interpretation of the research question was wrong. After realizing what the research question actually was, I reformulated my plan and used separate linear multiple regression models to regress the different measures of wellbeing (physical, psychological, social, general, and overall) on to the predictor (religiosity), the covariates (age, gender, ses, education, and religious denomination), the moderator (perception of country-level cultural norms about religiosity), and the interaction between the predictor and the moderator.

Simple Slopes for Religiosity. We examined simple slopes of religiosity at + 1 SD of norms. For this pair of analyses, computed four new variables. One new variable was for examining the simple slope of religiosity at +1 SD on standardized norms (norms_high = Zreligiosity_norms – 1). A second new variable was the interaction effect for examining this simple slope (relig_x_norms_high). A third new variable was for examining the simple slope of religiosity at -1 SD on standardized norms (norms_low = Zreligiosity_norms + 1). The fourth new variable was the interaction effect for examining this simple slope (relig_x_norms_low). To check the simple slopes of religiosity at + 1 SD of norms on a dependent variable, we conducted a simultaneous multiple regression analysis with these predictors: z-scored religiosity, the relig_x_norms_high interaction term, and norms_high. To check the simple slopes of religiosity at - 1 SD of norms on a dependent variable, we conducted a simultaneous multiple regression analysis with these predictors: z-scored religiosity, the relig_x_norms_low interaction term, and norms_low. In these analyses, only the coefficients for z-scored religiosity get interpreted.

Simple Slopes for Norms. We also examined simple slopes of norms at + 1 SD of religiosity. For this pair of analyses, computed four new variables. One new variable was for examining the simple slope of norms at +1 SD on standardized religiosity (relig_high = Zreligious_beh_att – 1). A second new variable was the interaction effect for examining this simple slope (norms_x_relig_high). The third new variable was for examining the simple slope of norms at -1 SD on standardized religiosity (relig_low = Zreligious_beh_att + 1). The fourth new variable was the interaction effect for examining this simple slope (norms_x_relig_low). To check the simple slopes of norms at + 1 SD of religiosity on a dependent variable, we conducted a simultaneous multiple regression analysis with these predictors: z-scored norms, the norms_x_relig_high interaction term, and relig_high. To check the simple slopes of religiosity at - 1 SD of norms on a dependent variable, we conducted a simultaneous multiple regression analysis with these predictors: z-scored norms, the norms_x_relig_low interaction term, and relig_low. In these analyses, only the coefficients for z-scored norms get interpreted.

For RQ1, we ran the following models: Model 1: wb_comp ~ rel_comp
 Model 2: wb_comp ~ rel_comp Model 3: wb_comp ~ rel_comp Model 4: wb_comp ~ rel_comp Model 5: wb_comp ~ rel_comp Model 6: wb_comp ~ rel_comp Model 7: wb_comp ~ rel_comp Model 8: wb_comp ~ rel_comp

We then compared the performance of these models using a 10-fold cross-validation procedure with 200 repetitions and the root mean square error as loss function, using the xvalglms R package (see reference below).
Briefly, the cross-validation procedure we used divides the dataset into a calibration set and a validation set. The models are fit in the calibration set. The estimated parameters are then used in the validation set to compute predictions. We split the data into 10 independent sets of observations (10 folds), and used each of these 10 sets in turn as the validation set, and the other 9 as the calibration set. We repeated this procedure 200 times, to make sure there was no bias due to a particular partitioning of the data, and to count how many times a particular model won. For each repeat, we calculated the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEp), as a measure of how well the model predicted the unseen data in the validation set. We selected the model with the most wins (i.e., the model with the largest percentage of times of having a smaller prediction error than the other models across repeats).
For RQ2, we took the winning model from RQ1, and then ran the same model, but included cnorm_comp as a moderator variable. For this model, we tested for an interaction between rel_comp and cnorm_comp. In our case the model specification was:
wb_comp ~ rel_comp + age + ses + education + cnorm_comp + rel_comp:cnorm_comp

The first step included the sociodemographic variables: age, perceived socioeconomic status, and education.
The second step added religiosity to the model.
•	This step allowed us to assess RQ1: Do religious people self-report higher well-being?
The third step added the variable for perceived religious norms and an interaction term combining perceived religious norms and religiosity.
•	This step allowed me to test RQ2: Does the relation between self-reported religiosity and well-being depend on how important people consider religion to be in their country (i.e., perceived cultural norms of religion)? We interpret “depend on” to mean: is there an interaction effect between religiosity and perceived religious norms. Including the interaction term in step 3 is a common method for detecting interaction effects in hierarchical regressions.

I then use an ANOVA to compare these different models.
","Each participant’s religiosity was operationalized as an average of: frequency of service attendance (rel_1 [R]), frequency of prayer (rel_2 [R]), self-identification (rel_3 [R]), belonging to a denomination (rel_4 [R]), belief in God/Gods (rel_5), belief in afterlife (rel_6), importance of religious lifestyle (rel_8), importance of belief in God/Gods (rel_9). Within our variable for religiosity, we left out the responses about spirituality (rel_7) since this identification can have varying meanings across different cultural contexts.
","I broke well-being into four different categories, following the method already performed in the database.
Each participant’s physical well-being was operationalized as the average of their responses to wb_phys_1-7 (wb_phys_mean).
Each participant’s psychological well-being was operationalized as the average of their responses to wb_psych_1-6 (wb_psych_mean).
Each participant’s social well-being was operationalized as the average of their responses to wb_soc_1-3 (wb_soc_mean).
And finally, I also used the overall average of all well-being questions for a general measure of well-being (wb_overall_mean).

For both RQ1 and RQ2 I used all four DVs because there are good reasons to suspect distinct relationships between religiosity, perceived norms, and psychological vs. physical vs. social health.

Multiple multivariate regression models were run to test the main effects of religiosity predictors (four items, separately tested) and their interactions with cultural norms (one item).  
Each regression model always control for potential confounding demographic variables, age and ses, which have been consistent predictors of wellbeing.
","Religiosity were operationalized as four items: rel_1 (religious behaviors), rel_3 (self-identified religiosity), rel_7 (spirituality), rel_8 (valuing religiosity). 
Some other items in the survey were related to religiosity, but were not used because they were not viewed as the most appropriate. For example, “rel_5 To what extent do you believe in God?” may not apply to all cultures or all religions.
In the end of my R code, I left notes that if I am to give a single pair of effect sizes and p values, I will use a combined, averaged score of the four religiosity items, because: 1) they are highly correlated and have high internal consistency, so they can be averaged; 2) I planned to use them separately, but they have very similar effect sizes and significance levels; 3) for brevity, they will be combined into a single predictor for drawing an overall conclusion. The effect sizes I reported are based on the averaged religiosity scores (current main results), instead of four individual item scores (pre-registered plan).
","The two questions share the same DV, wellbeing. The main outcome variable will be holistic well-being, the averaged scores of the following well-being indicators (standardized across the whole sample before averaging):
-	Perceived life quality (“How would you rate your quality of life?”) wb_gen_1
-	Hedonic well-being (“How much do you enjoy life?”), wb_psych_1
-	Meaning in life (“To what extent do you feel your life to be meaningful?”) wb_psych_2
-	Self-esteem (“How satisfied are you with yourself?”), wb_psych_5
-	Social well-being (averaged ratings of “How satisfied are you with your personal relationships?”, and “How satisfied are you with the support you get from your friends?” wb_soc_1 and wb_soc_2
-	Less emotional distress (How often do you have negative feelings such as blue mood, despair, anxiety, depression) wb_psych_6.
Meaning in life and perceived life quality will also be outcomes that are separately regressed onto religiosity, as a part of planned analyses with confirmatory hypotheses. See my answers to Q No.9 in this document
I picked these two because theoretically, they should be wellbeing dimensions that are more closely linked to religiosity and eudaimonic wellbeing vs. hedonic wellbeing.
","Age and socioeconomic status (ses), two single items as controls in each regression model.","Standardised regression coefficient (beta), as given by the lm() function in R statistical software.","beta = .13, CI 95% = [.11, .15]. ","< .001","I did run models that use perceived life quality and meaning in life as two wellbeing dimensions. They were combined with other wellbeing dimensions into my main outcome, holistic wellbeing. However, I also analyzed these two dimensions in separate models (as pre-registered), because they are highly relevant to the eudaimonic nature of religiosity.

Models using four religiosity items to separately predict perceived life quality:
All four items were significant in predicting perceived life quality, but effect sizes are smaller than when using holistic wellbeing. Betas are .13*** for rel_1, rel_7, and rel_8, .11*** for rel_3.
Such main effects of religiosity are highly similar to what we got using hoslistic wellbeing, considering all wellbeing aspects/dimeions.

Models using four religiosity items to separately predict meaning in life:
All four items were significant in predicting meaning in life, but effect sizes are smaller than when using holistic wellbeing. Betas are .20*** for all four IVs, rel_1, rel_3, rel_7, and rel_8.
These effect sizes are stronger than when using holistic wellbeing as the outcome, indicating that religiosity’s positive effect on holistic wellbeing is at least partially driven by its positive effect on meaning in life.

Summary: Religiosity predicted higher perceived life quality (in addition to overall wellbeing) for people with similar ages and socioeconomic status. This association does not depend on cultural norms.

No significant interactions for meaning in life. Betas of the interactions are .08* for rel_1*cnorm_1, rel_7*cnorm_1, and rel_8*cnorm_1, .13*** for rel_3*cnorm_1.

More specifically, we constrained the number of factors to be equal across groups and tested for configural invariance (i.e., the invariance of the structure in terms of the number of factors and zero loadings). Because configural invariance was already violated, we refrained from conducting any further analyses and suggest to use an exploratory approach, Mixture multigroup factor analysis (De Roover, Vermunt, & Ceulemans, 2020), to find clusters of countries with comparable constructs. 
Note that invariance analyses for religiosity slightly deviate from the one in the pre-registration because we misunderstood the documentation and thought that religiosity with was assessed on a dichotomous 0 and 1 scale (that, in the test dataset, was made continuous in order to any eliminated effects) but instead it was meant that religiosity was assessed on a 0 to 1 continuous scale.","No, the evidence is ambiguous","No",5,"In the multivariate linear regression model, to test RQ2, we would have included the following independent variables (in addition to the variable RELF from RQ1):

-	Two interaction terms between religiosity and the dummy variables indicated in the bullet above. These indices would have been coded in the dataset as
IntRELCN1 and IntRELCN2.

Logistic regression is for modeling situations when the response variable is categorical and binary (yes/no, 1/0, true/false type variables). For example, predicting if a kicker will make a field goal or miss it. Instead of predicted values in the data space, logistic regression provides log-odds of success. The log-odds can be translated into odds or probability of success. In the field goal example, the fitted values from the model could be translated into a probability of making the field goal, with the probability bounded by [0, 1]. 

Ordinal logistic regression extends this method to response variables that are categorical, with more than two levels. The levels must be ordered (that's the ordinal part), so it works well for Likert-scale data. In this case, our response variable was measured on a 5-point scale.

The goal is to estimate the direction and/or magnitude of an effect across all relevant studies/data.  Meta-analysis provides an organized approach for handling a large number of studies. Second, the process is systematic and documented in great detail, which allows readers to evaluate the researchers’ decisions and conclusions. Third, meta-analysis allows researchers to examine an effect within a collection of studies in a more sophisticated manner than a qualitative summary.

In such a model (the SEM), we add (in addition the the structural model containing the inter-variable effects) measurement models for each latent variable. In these measurement models, each latent variable is connected to one, two or more indicators that are presumeably caused by the latent variable. The full model tries to explain the covariance between all observed variables (indicators) by the full set of paths connecting these.","We operationalize the independent variable in terms of mean and standard deviation.","We operationalize the independent variable in terms of mean and standard deviation.

In addition these variables were latent constructs so the items of interest were loaded on these latent constructs. We tested how items of the religious questionnaire loaded onto 3 underlying constructs (ideology, private practice and public practice), allowed these 3 latent constructs to predict a 3rd underlying construct ""religiosity"". We then allowed religiosity to predict the 3 well being measures- physical, social and psychological well-being as to see whether there were significant relationships. Furthermore, in order to assess whether this relationship differed between cultural norms, multigroup analysis was performed where cultural norms was used as the group (consisted of 5 groups, 1 multigroup analysis was performed for each cultural norms (cnorm_1 and cnorm_2). Multigroup analysis means that an initial model is run where all parameters are allowed to differ between groups, followed by a model where all parameters are constrained to be equal across groups. These models are then compared and if the freed model is a significantly better fit, we know that some parameters (or all) differ between groups. Our interest was whether the paths between religiosity and each of the well-being measures differed across groups. We therefore run ""partial models"" where all parameters were constrained apart from one of the paths between religiosity and well-being, one at a time. And we assessed whether allowing this path to be different across groups was significant.

Both cultural norm questions were scored on a Likert scale from 1 (Not at all important) to 5 (Extremely important). 
 
Prior to calculation of the religiosity and cultural norms scores, all items were standardised, such that the items (and the final means) had a potential range of 0 to 1, with higher scores representing higher religiosity and perceived importance of religiosity in one’s immediate culture, respectively.  

As we specified on the Stage 1 analysis, the religiosity by cultural norm interaction is the main independent variable to answer Q2.","For our outcome variable, we used the existing overall well-being score contained in the dataset.

For instance, in this analysis the observations of individuals are nested within different countries. Thus multi-level models take into account that individual observations are not unrelated to each other (as compared to linear regression) which often leads to better parameter estimates on average (Effron & Morris, 1977). For a general overview of multi-level models see for instance Gelman and Hill (2007).  

 For inference testing, we stepwise extended linear multi-level regression models by adding predictors of interest. Models were then compared based on the Bayesian Information criterion (BIC). When the differences in BIC between the simple and the more complex model was greater than 2 (based on Raftery, 1995), we interpreted this as support for the more complex model.","Aggregated subjective religiosity (srel) was calculated as the mean of the

","For Hypothesis 1, we simultaneously estimated the relative contribution of various aspects of religiosity and its relations to overall psychological well-being on the individual- and on the culture-level. 

For Hypotheses 2, we examined if cultural norms of religiosity moderate the relations between religiosity and psychological well-being separately for each aspect of religiosity and at the individual- and culture-level, respectively. In these models, we simultaneously estimated whether cultural norms of religiosity moderated the relations between various indicators of religiosity and psychological well-being at the individual- and at the culture-level.","We used the following independent variables as indicators of religiosity for research questions 1 and 2: 
•	institutional and private religious practices (rel_1, rel_2), 
•	self-identification (rel_3), 
•	religious beliefs in God and afterlife (rel_5, rel_6), 
•	spirituality (rel_7), and
•	centrality of religion (“relcent”: mean composite of rel_8 and rel_9)

We operationalized centrality of religion as a mean composite score of the variables rel_8 and rel_9 (please see SPSS data cleaning code for more information). 
After accessing the data, we realized that self-identification (rel_3) should have been treated as a categorical variable instead of using it as a continuous variable as we had planned to use it in our pre-registration. We ran the analyses both ways where rel_3 was treated as a continuous as well as a categorical variable (dummy-coded) and the pattern of findings related this variable did not show any differences. Given that there were not enough compelling reasons to deviate from our original plan, we treated rel_3 as a continuous variable. 

For research question 2, we assessed cultural norms of religiosity as a mean composite score of cnorm_1 and c_norm2. Cultural norms of religiosity was operationalized as a moderator. In other words, it was entered as an independent variable (i.e., main effect) and as an interaction term between rel_1, rel_2, rel_3, rel_5, rel_6, rel_7, and centrality of religion (in separate models each) at the individual- and culture-level.
","We used the average of the psychological well-being subscale (#34 wb_psych_mean) as the dependent variable in all of our analyses.","We entered age (#36), gender (#37), SES (38), and education (#39), as covariates on the individual-level, and gdp_scaled (#43) was entered as a covariate on the culture-level.

Given that minority status varies within, rather than between, countries, we were not able to execute our exploratory analyses.

Although we did not plan for it in the initial analyses, we modified the following as part of the data cleaning process and BEFORE we ran any analyses:

Important! In this model the interaction was statistically significant. However, to be consistent, we have not interpreted these results since religiosity and perceived cultural norm of religiosity were not enabled to vary within country.

In this specific model the relationship between perceived cultural norm of religiosity and well-being was limited by a significant interaction between religiosity and perceived cultural norm of religiosity. Specifically, at the lower level of religiosity (–1SD), the relationship between the perceived cultural norm of religiosity and well-being was statistically non-significant, bcultural norms = 0.041, 95% CI [–0.042, 0.123], t(83.61) = 0.965, p = 0.337, whereas at the medium and high levels of religiosity this relationship between perceived cultural norm of religiosity and well-being was positive and statistically significant, bcultural norms = 0.091, 95% CI [0.018, 0.165], t(28.96) = 2.54, p = 0.0167, bcultural norms = 0.142, 95% CI [0.039, 0.245], t(86.61) = 2.86, p = 0.008, respectively.

","Overall, we conducted eight multilevel models – one for each indicator of well-being. Multilevel analyses are the most appropriate approach for investigating this research question and handling the data structure. First, it is necessary to account for the nesting of the data because residuals are not independent if respondents are nested within countries. Second, it might be that the religiosity-well-being relationship on country level is different from the relationship within countries. 
For medical well-being, the models included random intercepts and random slopes for individual-level religiosity and its quadratic term. For all other indices of well-being, the models included random intercepts and random slopes for individual-level religiosity as linear term only.
Conceptually, our basic model examined whether individual and/ or country-level religiosity is related to well-being. Thus, for each indicator of well-being, we regressed well-being on the following four predictors by using maximum likelihood (ML) estimation: a) Individual-level religiosity (level-1) b) Country-level religiosity (level-2) c) The second-order orthogonal polynomial of a) d) The second-order orthogonal polynomial of b).
All variables were z-standardized at the grand mean to obtain regression weights that are directly interpretable as effect sizes (β values; Snijders & Bosker, 2012). Furthermore, all level-1 variables were group-mean centered (i.e., centered on the country mean) in order to interpret the interaction unambiguously (Endres & Tofighi, 2007). Specifically, country-level religiosity scores (level-2) were assessed by aggregating respondents´ answers to the individual religiosity measure within each country and then zstandardizing these scores (see Diener et al., 2011). Individual religiosity scores (level-1) were first centered at the country mean and then z-standardized.
","
We assessed religiosity as a single construct by computing the mean
over the 9 single religiosity indices. All variables were z-standardized at the grand mean (Snijders & Bosker, 2012). Furthermore, all level-1 variables were group-mean centered (i.e., centered on the country mean) in order to interpret the interaction unambiguously (Endres & Tofighi, 2007). Specifically, country-level religiosity scores (level-2) were assessed by aggregating respondents´ answers to the individual religiosity measure within each country and then zstandardizing these scores (see Diener et al., 2011). Individual religiosity scores (level-1) were first centered at the country mean and then z-standardized.","We computed the following five types of well-being: overall well-being (all items except for phys_1 and phys_2), medical well-being (phys_1, phys_2), physical well-being (phys_3, phys_4, phys_5, phys_6, phys_7), psychological well-being (psych_1, psych_2, psych_3, psych_4, psych_5, psych_6), social well-being (soc_1, soc_2, soc_3), general well-being (gen_1, gen_2). 
The respective items were aggregated via mean computation. For item soc_3, there were a few missing values. Thus, we also conducted the same multilevel factor analysis without this item which revealed very similar results. For participants with missing values on this item, we computed social well-being without item soc_3. 
Additionally, we used the single items gen_1, gen_2, and psych_5 as further indicators of well-being since they represent common single-item measures of quality of life (QoL), satisfaction with health (SwH), and self-esteem (Se).
 All variables were z-standardized at the grand mean (Snijders & Bosker, 2012).","We included the following variables into the model: age, socioeconomic status (SES), education, and male gender on individual level (level-1), and GDP on country level (level-2). On the individual-level, age, SES, and education were
standardized within countries. Male gender was coded with 1 = male and 0 = other genders.
GDP as country-level covariate was centered at the grand mean while adjusting/weighting
for different cluster sizes in the sample. ","We interpreted the standardised regression coefficient (beta) as effect size. Note, however, that the regression coefficients oft he quadratic religiosity terms cannot be interpreted as an effect size of the quadratic effect since we used second-order orthogonal polynomials.","If we were violently forced to select only one of the results reported in Table 1 to answer RQ1, it would be the linear effect of individual-level religiosity for the overall well-being score without controlling for other variables, β = .145 [.096; .194], p < .001. Thus, there is a small positive relationship between religiosity and well-being. ","p < .001","The most straightforward way to answer research question 1 is
a Pearson correlation of religiosity and well-being. The zero-order correlations of religiosity and well-being were all significant and positive, except for medical well-being. Medical well-being had a significantly negative relationship with religiosity.
However, Pearson correlations are less appropriate to examine this research
question.","Yes, there is good evidence for a positive relation","Yes",6,"We used the same operationalizations of religiosity as in the analyses of research question 1. We assessed religiosity as a single construct by computing the mean
over the 9 single religiosity indices. All variables were z-standardized at the grand mean (Snijders & Bosker, 2012). Furthermore, all level-1 variables were group-mean centered (i.e., centered on the country mean) in order to interpret the interaction unambiguously (Endres & Tofighi, 2007). Specifically, country-level religiosity scores (level-2) were assessed by aggregating respondents´ answers to the individual religiosity measure within each country and then zstandardizing these scores (see Diener et al., 2011). Individual religiosity scores (level-1) were first centered at the country mean and then z-standardized.

Cultural norms can be assessed by different operationalizations. First, cultural norms can be directly assessed as in perceived cultural norms (PCN). We assessed PCN as a single construct on the individual- level as well as on the country-level by computing the mean over the 2 single religiosity indices.
Second, cultural norms can also be assessed indirectly by averaging the respondents´ answers on the individual religiosity indice within each country. These country-level religiosity indices reflect actual descriptive objective norms on a theoretical level more accurately.
Furthermore, next to the overall mean levels of religiosity or cultural norms within a
country, the strength of these norms might also have a strong influence on the religiositywell-being relation. The strength of a norm can be operationalized in terms of religious heterogeneity within a country. This religious heterogeneity can be assessed by heterogeneity of the PCN or by the heterogeneity of the objective cultural norms. In both cases, heterogeneity can be statistically expressed via the standard deviations within a country (level-2). As for all aggregated variables (level-2), both indices were z-standardized.","We used the same operationalizations of well-being as in the analyses of research question 1. We computed the following five types of well-being: overall well-being (all items except for phys_1 and phys_2), medical well-being (phys_1, phys_2), physical well-being (phys_3, phys_4, phys_5, phys_6, phys_7), psychological well-being (psych_1, psych_2, psych_3, psych_4, psych_5, psych_6), social well-being (soc_1, soc_2, soc_3), general well-being (gen_1, gen_2). 
The respective items were aggregated via mean computation. For item soc_3, there were a few missing values. Thus, we also conducted the same multilevel factor analysis without this item which revealed very similar results. For participants with missing values on this item, we computed social well-being without item soc_3.

GDP as country-level covariate was centered at the grand mean while adjusting/weighting
for different cluster sizes in the sample. ","We interpreted the standardised regression coefficient (beta) as effect size. Note, however, that the regression coefficients oft he quadratic religiosity terms cannot be interpreted as an effect size of the quadratic effect since we used second-order orthogonal polynomials.","If we had to subtract one single effect size to answer RQ2 (which we would heavily object to), it would be the moderating influence of individual-level PCNs (as a subjective norm) on the linear relationship between individual-level religiosity and overall well-being without controlling for any variable: β = .009, 95%CI [-.008, .026], p = .284. In sum, the results of the analyses were largely consistent across the different indices of well-being. The only exception is medical well-being. Compared to the other indices, this indice seems to have another religiosity-well-being relation. First, it is the only indice with a negative relationship. Second, it is the only indice with a consistent moderating effect for perceived cultural norms (PCN) of religiosity but not for country-level religiosity. For all other indices, the relation between religiosity and self-reported well-being did not depend on subjective PCNs, but on country-level religiosity.","p = .284","To test research question 2 holistically, for each well-being indice, we performed six
different models (model 1 to model 5b).
In model 1, we tested the hypothesis whether the religiosity-well-being relation
depends on individual-level PCN of religiosity. For this purpose, we added the individuallevel PCN scores into the model and their interactions with both the linear and the quadratic
effect within countries.

In model 2, we additionally take the moderating influence of a country´s objective
religiosity into account. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis whether the religiosity-wellbeing relation depends on the objective religiosity norms of a country. For this purpose, the country-level religiosity (level-2) was included in the model as well as its interaction with
individual-level religiosity (level-1). 
 The result pattern remains the same as in
model 1: There was a significant main effect for individual-level religiosity and (in most
cases) individual-level perceived cultural norms, but no significant main effect of countrylevel religiosity on the different indices of well-being (except for medical well-being).
Furthermore, there was no significant interaction between individual-level religiosity and
individual-level perceived cultural norms (except for medical well-being).
For all indices, country-level religiosity had a moderating effect on the linear
individual-level religiosity-well-being relationship: The more religious a country is, the
stronger is the relationship between individual-level religiosity and well-being indicating that
religious people living in religious countries have a better well-being. Again, the exception is
medical well-being. For medical well-being, there was no moderating effect of countrylevel religiosity on the linear relationship between religiosity and medical well-being.

In model 3, we additionally take the moderating influence of the heterogeneity of a
country´s objective religiosity into account. The heterogeneity of a country´s objective
religiosity should be an indicator for the strength of the religiosity norms. We assume that the smaller the heterogeneity of a country´s objective religiosity, the stronger are the objective religiosity norms in a country. To test whether the religiosity-well-being relation depends on the strength of the objective religiosity norms in a country, we included the standard deviation of religiosity within a country (level-2) in the model as well as its interaction with individual-level religiosity (linear and quadratic, level-1).
Overall, the heterogeneity of the objective religiosity of a country had no effect
on the religiosity-well-being relationship for neither the linear nor the quadratic effect. For
medical well-being, however, there was a moderating effect of cultural norms on the
quadratic relationship between religiosity and medical well-being as well as religiosity
and social well-being.

Model 4 was equivalent to model 3. However, instead of the heterogeneity of the
objective religiosity in a country, we took the moderating influence of the heterogeneity of the individual-level PCN in a country (level-2) into account (see equation 5). Again, we assume that the smaller the heterogeneity the individual-level PCN in a country, the stronger are the objective religiosity norms in a country. To test whether the religiosity-well-being relation depends on the strength of the individual perceived religiosity norms in a country, we included the standard deviation of PCN within a country (level-2) in the model as well as its interaction with individual-level religiosity (linear and quadratic, level-1). 
Overall, the heterogeneity of the perceived cultural norm of religiosity in a
country had no effect on the religiosity-well-being relationship for neither the linear nor
the quadratic effect. For social well-being, however, there was a moderating effect of
cultural norms on the quadratic effect of religiosity.

In Model 5a and 5b, we examined whether the results of model 3 and 4 could be
(partially) traced back to sociodemographic variables that are usually correlated with both
religiosity and well-being. As for research question 1, we controlled for gender, age,
socioeconomic status (SES), education on individual-level, and GDP on country-level. By
repeating model 3 (see equation 6a) and 4 (see equation 6b), we added these covariates,
modeling their main effect on well-being as well as their interactions with individual-level
religiosity (only the linear term).

As described in HA2 and HA3, we examined the relationship between religiosity and well-being among participants living in countries where their religion is and is not the majority. To do that, we firstly specify major religion of each country. In doing so, we refer to the data from Pew Research Center regarding Religious Composition by Country in 2020 (https://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/religious-projection-table/2020/number/all/). For this analysis, only five religious denominations were analysed based on data availability: Christian, Islam, Buddhist, Hindu, and Judaism/Jewish. The classification of participants’ religion is also simplified by grouping all Christian and Catholic denomination (response 3–6 in Religion) into a single Christian group, and all Muslim deonominations (response13–16 in Religion) into a single Islam group, and merging Shinto and Buddhist into a single “Buddhist” group.

HA2 = If the cultural norms towards one’s religion is high, then the relationship between religiosity and well-being will be higher for individuals living in countries where their religious denomination is the majority.

Participants’ levels of cultural norms are considered high when the z-score of cultural norms is above 1, and are considered low when their score is –1. 

Pearson’s analysis showed that for participants living in countries where their religion is the majority (n = 760), there is a significant positive relationship (r= .149; p =. 000) between religiosity and well-being. Interestingly, for participants who lives in a minority religious group (n = 203), there is a relatively stronger positive association (r = .231; p = .001) between religiosity and well-being. We then perform the Fisher r-to-z transformation (http://vassarstats.net/rdiff.html) to calculate the significance of the difference between two correlation coefficients. The results suggest that the difference was not statistically significant (p = .285). Hence, HA2 is not supported. 

HA3: If the cultural norms towards one’s religion is low, then the relationship between religiosity and well-being will be lower for individuals living in countries where their religious denomination is the minority.

We performed similar analysis for participants who reported low scores of perceived cultural norms. For participants of majority religious group (n = 416), religiosity is positively associated (r = .110; p = .025) with well-being. For participants of minority religious group (n = 122), religiosity is not significantly associated (r = .007; p = .937) with well-being, giving a positive answer to HA3.

● Robustness analysis using the individual deviation from the perceived cultural norm as
main and interaction effects in the final model from RQ2
○ Results: The effect of religiosity on well-being persists when the deviation
measure is added to the model (including control variables). This indicates that
our analyses are robust. When the deviation measure is included as an
interaction term with religiosity, the main effects of religiosity and the deviation
measure are significant, whereas the interaction is not. Additionally, including the
deviation measure increases the pseudo R2. Thus, the individual deviation from
the cultural norm has an effect on well-being (as proposed by the person-culture

In words: 1 s.d. increase in religious lifestyle (REL_F2) is associated with an increase in average well-being of 0.12 standard deviations 

2. We ran several robustness checks (see the annotated script) which confirm the above results.
Noteworthy is the result where we regressed the two factors of well-being (WB_F1, which captures what we labeled as “general well-being”, and WB_F2, which captures health/medical well-being) on the religiosity variables (REL_F1, REL_F2) and all controls. See section “H2” in the script.
For general well-being (WB_F1) we find:
REL_F1: 0.0985, p=0.000
REL_F2: 0.1166, p=0.000

For health/medical well-being (WB_F2) we find:
REL_F1: -0.0496, p=0.000
REL_F2: -0.0358, p=0.000

Thus, while religiosity - both beliefs (REL_F1) and lifestyle (REL_F2) - is positively associated with general well-being (WB_F1), it is negatively associated with health/medical well-being (WB_F2). We interpret the latter result as people with worse health seeking more support from religion.
